Requires at least: 2.9
Tested up to: 3.2.1
Stable tag: 1.0.6

Advanced WordPress search with wildcards, highlighting, log, and ability to search all post data. Now with Lucene!

== Description ==

Extends the standard WordPress search to include data from posts, pages, comments, and meta-data, as well as the full content of data inserted by plugins. This last feature makes
it unique amongst search plugins.  For example, you may have a plugin that uses shortcodes to insert data:

[product 1]

The standard search will just see the shortcode. Search Unleashed will see the actual data inserted into your post.

Search phrases are highlighted, as are incoming searches from Google, Yahoo, and most other search engines. This makes it very easy to see exactly what phrase matched and why the post is being shown.

Searches can be restricted to specific categories, tags, or meta-data. For example, you can search for 'persian' in the 'cats' category.

* Transparently extends WordPress search with a full text search that supports wildcards and logical operations
* Search through posts, pages, comments, meta-data, urls, and titles
* Priority based searching - configure how much priority to give to the various parts of a post
* Extendable search engines. Comes with three search engines (standard, MySQL fulltext, and Lucene)
* Data from plugins is included in the search - this is very important as previously any plugins that inserted data into
posts were not included in searches
* Everything can be configured - select exactly what data you want to search
* Smart highlighting that shows a contextual snapshot of the search data
* Incoming search highlight.  Searches made through Google, Yahoo, Altavista, Baidu, Sogou, and MSN are all highlighted
* No changes are made to standard WordPress database tables
* Advanced search widget

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does this work? =

An index is made of all appropriate data, including the output from any plugins.  Typically this does not occur as the standard
WordPress search is made against raw data, as opposed to data that has been processed by plugins.

Only relevant data is included in the index to keep the index as small and fast as possible.

The index is updated anytime a post is edited.
