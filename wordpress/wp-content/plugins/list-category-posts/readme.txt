Tags: list, categories, posts, cms
Requires at least: 2.8
Tested up to: 3.2.1
Stable tag: 0.19.1

== Description ==
List Category Posts allows you to list posts from a category into a post/page using the [catlist] shortcode.

The shortcode accepts a category name or id, the order in which you want the posts to display, and the number of posts to display. You can also display the post author, date, excerpt, custom field values, even the content! The [catlist] shortcode can be used as many times as needed with different arguments on each post/page.

Great to use WordPress as a CMS, and create pages with several categories posts.

The plugin includes a widget, which works pretty much the same as the plugin. Just add as many widgets as you want, and select all the available options from the Appearence > Widgets page.

Since version 0.18, **this plugins does not work on server with PHP 4**. If you're still using PHP 4 on your webhost, you should consider upgrading to PHP 5. WordPress 3.1 will be the last version to support PHP 4, from 3.2 and forward, only PHP 5 will be supported. You can still [download an older version of the plugin ] (https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/list-category-posts/download/ "download an older version of the plugin") if you're using PHP 4.

Works correctly with WordPress 3.1 and default Twenty Ten theme
(http://wordpress.org/support/topic/399754)

**Usage**: `[catlist argument1=value1 argument2=value2]`

==Installation==

* Upload listcat directory into you wp-content/plugins/ directory.
* Login to your WordPress Admin menu, go to Plugins, and activate it.
* Edit the default.php file on templates to customize the way the categories are displayed, or use the default one included in the plugin's code. You can use several different templates if you want.
* You can find the ListCategoryPostsWidget in the Appearence > Widgets section on your WordPress Dashboard.

==Other notes==

**Usage**
The arguments you can use are:

* **name** - To display posts from a category using the category's name. Ex: [catlist name=mycategory]

* **id** - To display posts from a category using the category's id. Ex: [catlist id=24]. You can **include several categories**: Ex: [catlist id=17,24,32] or **exclude** a category with the minus (-)  
If you use both arguments (wrong!), List Category Posts will show the posts from the category in 'name'.

* **tags** - Tag support, you can display posts from a certain tag. 

* **orderby** - To customize the order. Valid values are: 
  * **author** - Sort by the numeric author IDs.
  * **category** - Sort by the numeric category IDs.
  * **content** - Sort by content.
  * **date** - Sort by creation date.
  * **ID** - Sort by numeric post ID.
  * **menu_order** - Sort by the menu order. Only useful with pages.
  * **mime_type** - Sort by MIME type. Only useful with attachments.
  * **modified** - Sort by last modified date.
  * **name** - Sort by stub.
  * **parent** - Sort by parent ID.
  * **password** - Sort by password.
  * **rand** - Randomly sort results.
  * **status** - Sort by status.
  * **title** - Sort by title.
  * **type** - Sort by type. Ex: [catlist name=mycategory orderby=date]

* **order** - How to sort **orderby**. Valid values are:
  * **ASC** - Ascending (lowest to highest).
  * **DESC** - Descending (highest to lowest). Ex: [catlist name=mycategory orderby=title order=asc]

* **numberposts** - Number of posts to return. Set to 0 to use the max number of posts per page. Set to -1 to remove the limit. Default: 5. Ex: [catlist name=mycategory numberposts=10]

* **date** - Display post's date next to the title. Default is 'no', use date=yes to activate it.

* **author** - Display the post's author next to the title. Default is 'no', use author=yes to activate it.

* **dateformat** - Format of the date output. Default is get_option('date_format'). Check http://codex.wordpress.org/Formatting_Date_and_Time for possible formats.

* **template** - File name of template from templates directory without extension. Example: For 'template.php' value is only 'template'. Default is 'default', which displays an unordered list (ul html tag) with a CSS class. This class can be passed as a parameter or by default it's: 'lcp_catlist'. You can also use the default 'div' value. This will output a div with the 'lcp_catlist' CSS class (or one you pass as parameter with the class argument). The inner items (posts) will be displayed between p tags.

* **excerpt** - Display the post's excerpt. Default is 'no', use excerpt=yes to activate it.

* **excludeposts** - IDs of posts to exclude from the list. Ex: [catlist excludeposts=12,52,37]

* **offset** - You can displace or pass over one or more initial posts which would normally be collected by your query through the use of the offset parameter.

* **content** - Show the full content of the post. Default is 'no'. Ex: [catlist content=yes]

* **catlink** - Show the title of the category with a link to the category. Use the template system to customize its display using the variable $cat_link_string. Default is 'no'. Ex: [catlist catlink=yes]. The way it's programmed, it should only display the title for the first category you chose, and include the posts from all of the categories. I thought of this parameter mostly for using several shortcodes on one page or post, so that each group of posts would have the title of that group's category. If you need to display several titles with posts, you should use one [catlist] shortcode for each category you want to display.

* **comments** - Show comments count for each post. Default is 'no'. Ex: [catlist comments=yes].

* **thumbnail** - Show post thumbnail (http://markjaquith.wordpress.com/2009/12/23/new-in-wordpress-2-9-post-thumbnail-images/). Default is 'no'. Ex: [catlist thumbnail=yes].

* **thumbnail_size** - Either a string keyword (thumbnail, medium, large or full) or a 2-item array representing width and height in pixels, e.g. array(32,32).

* **post_type** - The type of post to show. Available options are: post - Default, page, attachment, any - all post types.

* **post_parent** - Show only the children of the post with this ID. Default: None.

* **class** - CSS class for the default UL generated by the plugin.

* **custom fields** - To use custom fields, you must specify two values: customfield_name and customfield_value. Using this only show posts that contain a custom field with this name and value. Both parameters must be defined, or neither will work.

* **customfield_display** - Display custom field(s). You can specify many fields to show, separating them with a coma.
