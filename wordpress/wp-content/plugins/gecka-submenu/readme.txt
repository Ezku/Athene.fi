Submenu autopopulates any nav menu page item with its children and allows to put menus, or portion of menus, anywhere in your site.


== Description ==

**PHP 5 required. Please be sure to check your PHP version before marking the plugin as broken.**

Submenu enhances the WordPress 3.x navigation system. When you have a website based on WordPress with a lot of pages, but you need a custom menu, it can be tedious to have to add a menu entry for each page created. Submenu just does it automatically.  
  
Submenu also allows you to put menus or portion of menus anywhere in your site: sidebar, templates or page contents.
